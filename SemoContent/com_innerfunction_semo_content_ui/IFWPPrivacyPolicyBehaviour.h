/**
 * A behaviour providing functionality for presenting a privacy policy to a user.
 * When this behaviour is attached to a view (controller), it first checks when the view
 * appears whether a flag is set which indicates that the privacy policy has been accepted.
 * If the flag isn't set then the behaviour presents modal view which should show the
 * privacy policy to the user and give them the option of accepting or rejecting the policy.
 * The behaviour recognizes two action messages:
 * 1. privacy-policy/accept: Set the flag indicating policy acceptance, and hide the policy view.
 * 2. privacy-policy/reject: Hide the policy view and post the reject action (e.g. to log out again).
 * NOTE that this behaviour operates per-app-instance, rather than per-user. This means that
 * if a user logs in, accepts the policy, then logs out again than the policy won't be represented
 * if the same or a different user logs in again with the same app installation.
