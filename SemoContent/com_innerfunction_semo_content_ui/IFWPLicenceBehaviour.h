/**
 * A view behaviour providing functionality for presenting a licence to a user, and for
 * prompting the user to accept or reject the licence.
 * When this behaviour is attached to a view (controller), it first checks when the view
 * appears whether a flag is set which indicates that the licence has been accepted by the
 * current user.
 * If the flag isn't set then the behaviour presents a modal view which should show the
 * licence text to the user and give them the option of accepting or rejecting the policy.
 * The behaviour recognizes two action messages:
 * 1. licence/accept: Set the flag indicating licence acceptance, and hide the licence view.
 * 2. licence/reject: Hide the licence view and post the reject action (e.g. to log out again).
