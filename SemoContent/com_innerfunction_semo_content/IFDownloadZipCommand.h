/**
 * A command to download a zip file from a remote location and unpack it to the device's filesystem.
 * NOTE: This is a fairly basic initial implementation of this command, needed to provide a bulk image
 * download function to the app (to downloaded initial image content after the app's installation).
 * The command doesn't block the command scheduler execution queue; rather the command returns control
 * to the scheduler as soon as the HTTP request has been submitted. The command schedules two follow
 * up commands (an unzip followed by an rm) once the request has completed.
 * The code needs to be reviewed WRT background execution. The command will loose state if the app is
 * terminated whilst the download is in progress - it may be possible instead for the command to
 * continue and resume despite this, but this needs further investigation.
 *
 * Arguments: <url> <path>
 * - url:       The URL to download.
 * - path:      A location to unzip the downloaded zip file to.
